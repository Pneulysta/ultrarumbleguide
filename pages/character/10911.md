# <a style="color: rgba(255,177,82,255) !important;">CHARACTER CLASSES</a><br>
In this sub-guide you'll learn about character classes and the colored backgrounds behind characters!

You might notice that some characters appear more than once with a different background color, like Red Bakugo and Blue Bakugo. These are the different sets of skills the character can use, for example, yellow Izuku Midoriya shoots, kicks, and can use blackwhip for mobility, while red Izuku Midoriya shoots, stomps the ground with the heel, and creates rock barriers. These colors indicate which role the set of skills is, which also indicates (or attempts to, since many characters fit other roles) what they specialize in:

</p>
Assault Characters can focus on defense and close-combat (like Yellow Itsuka Kendo and Yellow Eijiro Kirishima), have massive attacks that cover a wide area and are often slightly slow to execute (Yellow Endeavor, Young All For One, Mt Lady) or remain in a more neutral ground (Yellow Deku and Yellow Tomura Shigaraki).

Rapid Characters focus on agility and/or speed, they're often highly mobile and slippery characters that usually have an easy time moving from one place to another, and sometimes even be difficult to hit due to their agility or staying in the air for long.

Characters with this role are often referred to by the community as "Blue" or "Rapid", after which follows the character's name.
