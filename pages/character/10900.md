Present Mic is a high damage strike character with some of the highest DPS in the game, his gameplay is centered in absolutely melting the enemies from afar and upclose, using different tools to achieve this in each range, as well as the ability to apply a deafen debuff to impair the enemy's ability to hear their surroundings.

This is Present Mic's primary DPS tool and one of the best alphas in the game, it has an incredible range and deals outstanding DMG when paired with his Special Action. The damage of this ability decreases with distance, the farther away you are, the less damage it does, but in exchange, the projectile becomes bigger, so from upclose he does high DMG with a smaller projectile hitbox, while to far away targets he does less damage but it's easier to hit. Even then, he doesn't lose much damage at range, especially with his Special Action up.

## Beta Skill #1 - Loud Voice

Present Mic's beta skill (tap) is his primary combo starter and also benefits from his Special Action. It deals decently high DMG and stuns the enemy shortly, which acts as a setup for your high damage combos. It's also a very annoying skill, as it inflicts "Deafen" to the enemy, which makes them unable to hear anything except for a ringing noise, which can make it harder for them to accurately predict threats, as they won't be able to use sound to guess your position. It doesn't have insane range, but it does have more range than most people think. It also has the benefit of hitting around courners, as the object collision hitbox is smaller than the damaging hitbox.

When holding his beta skill, Present Mic will cast this variation instead, where he sends huge soundwaves that have outstanding range. It's a phenomenal 3rd party tool that has great zoning when combined with his Special Action, but it's also his most punishable move. There are several ways to use this ability, the best way to me is to third party, or use it for area denial with Special Action. If aimed properly it can down fleeing targets with exceptional range, can guardbreak a whole team if caught unaware, and can zone out long range characters, an incredibly valuable move that's either overused by novice players or underused by standard players.

## Gamma Skill - DJ Punch

Momo's gamma skill gives her the ability to place cannons that will shoot 3 cannonballs that will explode in smaller matryoshka bombs. This ability has insane range and DMG, being able to cause havoc from great distances. At higher levels (4 and 9) you get an extra cannon, which allows you to cover a greater area to make sure at least one hits (normally one targets the front, and the rest target the sides, this can be used to either hit the spot you predict your enemy will go to, or to prevent them from taking a specific path. A lone alpha should be sneaked in to maximize damage, but don't go for more or else you will risk putting the enemy on knockdown with an alpha rather than with a cannonball, losing valuable damage.<br>

</p>
<br>
Defensively, you can aim the cannons at a KOd ally's or enemy's remains to be able to loot while discouraging others from doing so and also giving you some protection against melee characters. If you're being chased, you can go indoors and place cannons in the way to discourage chasing, as the enemy will get hit badly if they decide to come inside anyways.

</p>
<br>
Additionally, these cannons can be aimed all the way up to shoot at the sky, doing this will make the cannonballs take a while to fall back and hit the ground, which makes it great for the small final circle, as people might think they're safe, that is, until the cannonballs finally land and hit them whole. It should also be added that each matryoshka bomb released from the cannonball's explosion deals about 50 DMG, which isn't much, but in tight spaces they can stack, leading to even greater DMG.

## Special Action - Radio Noise

Momo's special action allows her to summon a bag that will drop 4 to 5 items. It's recommended to use it at the beginning of the match to start with a large backpack, and if you're lucky, some extra levels. This ability should also be used when an ally is dead, this is because her Special Action spawns a resurrection card when this condition is met. Do this even if you already have one, as it never hurts to have 2 resurrection cards. The probability of getting each items is as follows:

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 3-string combo chain. It starts with a quick, short-range swing used to interrupt enemies and start melee-based combos, crucial for locking targets in place before chaining into Alphas or setting up cannon pressure. The second melee hit deals moderate damage and maintains stagger, keeping opponents locked in position. The third hit is where her melee truly shines, it launches a sledgehammer projectile, allowing Momo to punish enemies even from mid-range. If your Alpha skill isn’t leveled enough to close distance effectively, the sledgehammer can fill that gap great for catching running enemies or interrupting their skill animations. Furthermore, the great range along with being ranged yet still be considered a "melee attack" means she's the only character able to trigger tunes like Embrittlement or Sisterly Disposition from afar.<br>
<br>
Using the full melee chain is perfectly viable—it deals respectable damage and leaves opponents open for follow-ups. However, the third strike’s projectile is what truly makes her melee versatile, letting you punish enemies who think they’re safe at mid-range.

</br>

**Air Melee**<br>
Momo’s air melee is another underappreciated tool. After landing a hit with Alpha, you can jump and perform an air melee to extend your combo, then immediately follow with another Alpha as the target falls.
This move has excellent utility - it can knock enemies out of their skills, interrupt combos, and even occasionally break through Super Armor under certain conditions. While it’s not guaranteed every time due to game mechanics, the air melee is often worth attempting to regain control or punish overextensions.
