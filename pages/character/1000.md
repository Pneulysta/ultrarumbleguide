Momo Yaoyorozu is a hybrid support character who thrives on map control and team coordination. While she’s labeled as support, her toolkit allows her to flex between keeping her allies alive and turning into an unexpected threat when opportunities arise. Momo excels at setting up defenses, creating advantageous positions with her constructs, and punishing careless enemies who underestimate her low mobility.

Unlike typical supports, Momo’s strength lies in her adaptability, she can shift between defensive setups and sudden bursts of aggression, catching opponents off guard with well-placed cannons or shields. Her value skyrockets in enclosed or cover-rich environments where she can dictate the pace of fights, deny enemy entry points, and protect her team effectively. However, in open areas or against high-mobility characters, she can easily be overwhelmed due to her slower movement and limited escape options.

She relies in positioning and environmental awareness. She rewards strategic play, using walls, cars, and natural obstacles as extensions of her arsenal.

## Alpha Skill - Create: Strike and Stop

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch010/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch010_Unique1.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Momo's alpha skill allows her to swing at enemies to stop non-armored abilities and cancel movement skills to lock and stagger enemies in place, which makes it hard for the enemy to escape if not spammed. It serves as a "back off" ability to either stop a threat attacking your allies or yourself. If the enemy jumps, one well-timed alpha instantly knocks them to the ground, and you can loop this so long as you're not interrupted. You can also sneak an alpha when setting up a combo involving the gamma skill for some extra damage. It should be noted that her alpha counts as a projectile, so abilities like Mr. Compress's beta shield will reflect it back to you.

## Beta Skill - Create: Unfalling Castle Wall

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch010/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch010_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Momo's beta skill allows her to create a shield that can be used offensively, defensively, and supportively. When holding this ability, Momo will run forward with a shield that will block all incoming attacks so long as she takes them from the front, since Momo can't block non-directional attacks such as Ochaco's gamma (Both Rapid and Assault), or area attacks that come from behind her, as the shield does not cover her back. The ability to block attacks can be really useful against characters like Technical Todoroki that are usually hard to approach due to the large amounts of AoE attacks. However, this ability should not be used to run away, since even though it allows you to move faster, it leaves you exposed from behind while taking away your ability to dodge, rendering you vulnerable for a tiny speed boost.<br>
<br>
When the skill is tapped instead of holded (or at the end of the hold version) this ability does a good job at keeping yourself or your allies alive and buy you some time, as it can be used to cover an ally to give yourself some space to rescue them or let the timer run. It can also be used to block entrances/exits, either to prevent the enemy from reaching you/your teammates or to keep them trapped in a building and spam gamma cannons at them. This can also be useful to buy yourself time to heal or resurrect an ally.

## Gamma Skill - Create: Bullet Rain

<p align="center">

</p>
Momo's gamma skill gives her the ability to place cannons that will shoot 3 cannonballs that will explode in smaller matryoshka bombs. This ability has insane range and DMG, being able to cause havoc from great distances. At higher levels (4 and 9) you get an extra cannon, which allows you to cover a greater area to make sure at least one hits (normally one targets the front, and the rest target the sides, this can be used to either hit the spot you predict your enemy will go to, or to prevent them from taking a specific path. A lone alpha should be sneaked in to maximize damage, but don't go for more or else you will risk putting the enemy on knockdown with an alpha rather than with a cannonball, losing valuable damage.<br>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1000y-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1000y2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
<br>
Defensively, you can aim the cannons at a KOd ally's or enemy's remains to be able to loot while discouraging others from doing so and also giving you some protection against melee characters. If you're being chased, you can go indoors and place cannons in the way to discourage chasing, as the enemy will get hit badly if they decide to come inside anyways. 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1000y3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
<br>
Additionally, these cannons can be aimed all the way up to shoot at the sky, doing this will make the cannonballs take a while to fall back and hit the ground, which makes it great for the small final circle, as people might think they're safe, that is, until the cannonballs finally land and hit them whole. It should also be added that each matryoshka bomb released from the cannonball's explosion deals about 50 DMG, which isn't much, but in tight spaces they can stack, leading to even greater DMG.

## Special Action - Yaoyorozu's Lucky Bag

<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1000s-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
Momo's special action allows her to summon a bag that will drop 4 to 5 items. It's recommended to use it at the beginning of the match to start with a large backpack, and if you're lucky, some extra levels. This ability should also be used when an ally is dead, this is because her Special Action spawns a resurrection card when this condition is met. Do this even if you already have one, as it never hurts to have 2 resurrection cards. The probability of getting each items is as follows:

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 3-string combo chain is useful to smack people out of their fake selves and accept their inner kittens. It's useful in the production of femboys.

**Air Melee**<br>
Momo's air melee spawns femmies real nice.

## Leveling Paths
### Balanced Path
A path that keeps a balance between alpha and gamma levels, not neglecting the former. Once alpha and gamma are max level, you mostly care about beta being level 4, which you might already have thanks to ability cards. From here, you can either give the cards to your teammates or aim for beta level 9 if you're building a defensive setup.

### Why is Beta so low priority?
This ability is often countered, and level 1 allows you to cover a good chunk of entrances and exits already, plus, you often get there accidentally through ability cards. Meanwhile, alpha and gamma are abilities you will be actively using for both offense and defense, so you want those to be stronger.

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Catastrophe's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 175 DP<br>
Beta Skill: 500 DP<br>
Gamma Skill: 250 DP (Cannonball Explosion), 50 DP (Matryoshka Explosion)<br>
Ground Melee 1-2-3: 100 DP (Individually), 300 DP (Whole Chain)<br>
Air Melee: 250 DP<br>
<br>
The DMG of the following combos is classified under the tags "Basic DMG", "Light DMG", "Medium DMG", "High DMG", "Heavy DMG" and "Deadly DMG", given to combos that at max level do damage in the 100s, 200s, 300s, 400s, 500s and 600s respectively.

### Gamma -> (Gamma) -> Alpha
Simple but great combo for any 1v1 or even a team fight to shred GP. Place a cannon (preferably two) and hit one alpha between cannon explosions to stagger the enemy, not letting them dodge the cannon. Near walls or indoors, this combo can go from Medium DMG to High DMG thanks to the matryoshkas.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/high-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee 1 -> Alpha -> Beta
A close up quick combo. Land a melee attack following with an alpha and quickly dashing with a beta shield. Can be rolled out of if not quick enough or if the enemy rolls towards you. Rolling into any other side will hit. Can also protect and cancel enemy abilities. On slopes, the shield can hit a 2nd time sometimes, dealing Medium DMG instead of Light DMG.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee 1 -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Beta
A variation of the previous combo that adds an extra alpha. If it0s a 1v1, that won’t be interrupted by a third party. Can also protect and cancel enemy abilities.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/high-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma (Placing) -> Alpha -> Gamma (Hit) -> Beta
The most powerful Momo combo occurs when combining both Gamma DMG into Beta DMG. It's best in 1v1s, and it can also protect and cancel enemy abilities with beta. If this combo occurs indoors or near walls, the matryoshkas can add up to 100 DMG, and if you're also on a slope, you might get a 2nd beta hit, further increasing the damage.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/deadly-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma -> Gamma -> Beta
Similar to the previous but better when in team fights, because of the AoE Double Cannons. Can also protect and cancel enemy abilities.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Air Melee
Just 4 regular fist melees and finish with an air melee. Little DMG but annoying, as it won't let the enemy escape for the duration of it. Effective if you have a beamer teammate who can shoot the staggered target while you slowly melee them keeping them in place. Basically it's less of an offensive combo and more of a support combo to let your teammates be the ones doing the damage.

Momo gets countered by many characters if played in open areas with little to no cover. Most newer characters have huge AoE damage, large hitboxes, long range, and strong mobility, which Momo can struggle against. However, with dedication, Momo can still counter much of the meta.
Map awareness and playing around cover are crucial for Momo’s success. Using the map’s surroundings - trees, cars, walls, and other environmental features plays a huge role in her effectiveness. While this applies to any character, those with high mobility can sometimes ignore cover and engage head-on, as their movement abilities provide an escape option if things go wrong. Momo, lacking such mobility, relies heavily on the map to stay competitive. Positioning yourself near cover allows you to place cannons strategically, block attacks with your shield, and control engagements. Mastering map awareness is vital for turning Momo’s potential into victories.

## Izuku Midoriya (Both) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch001/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch001_profile.png" width="70"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch001var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
In open areas, Momo struggles significantly. Deku has long-range attacks and high mobility. However, if you play around cover and close the distance, it becomes a good fight. Don’t spam your alphas; use them strategically to keep Deku in place. Momo’s alphas can cancel movement abilities and sometimes go through Strike Deku’s Gamma wall, preventing him from jumping. If you see a Strike Deku falling from the sky to hit his Beta, a well-timed alpha will cancel it, leaving him vulnerable. Place cannons around to stagger him. If a Strike Deku is in the air, he can get two shots on you, so keep that in mind. Play cautiously around both, but engage close-range with Strike Deku.

## Katsuki Bakugo (Both) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch002/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch002_profile.png" width="70"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch002var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Similar to Deku. The Rapid version of Bakugo is far more powerful, but your alphas can cancel his escape and both his Beta and Gamma (he often uses them up close). The Strike version is easier to counter. Stay close, use your shield to cancel their Gammas, and prevent their escape with alphas. Engage aggressively.
<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch003/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch003_profile.png" width="70"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch003var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
They are hard to play against due to their AoE stun lock, so time your dodges well. Up close, you win. Predict their movements, place cannons, keep Ochaco in place with alphas and melee attacks, and use your shield to block her other attacks. If you get unexpectedly attacked, you’ll either die or be left with low HP, so fight indoors and place cannons strategically. Don’t stand near walls, as her Gamma can go through them. Engage confidently.

Skilled Iida’s will defeat Momo. Support your team and use alphas to prevent Iida from leaving or attacking you. Note that he’s one of the few Rapids who can still escape your staggering and run away. Roll his Beta, as it has Super Armor and ignores your alpha. Place cannons on top of yourself for protection.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Assault Kirishima isn’t a major threat to Momo. Dodge repeatedly, and you’re fine. He has Super Armor on every attack, so your alphas won’t always knock him away, be cautious.
Strike Kirishima is dangerous. His massive damage, AoE, movement, speed, and defense are hard to counter. Time your Beta dodge, use alphas to keep him in place, and try to explode him with cannons. He’s too fast and can escape, so play defensively. His Beta can be blocked by your shield, but it can bug and still hit you. Let your team handle both versions, and focus on supporting. Play extremely cautiously.
<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Both) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch007/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch007_profile.png" width="70"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch007var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Watch out for Denkis, they play evasively, and their stun + damage is extremely high. Dodge their stun, then do what Momo does best: keep them in place and explode with cannons. Don’t engage unless they’re in your face. Play cautiously.

Annoying and prone to escaping. Time your alphas to prevent him from fleeing. Easy to handle unless he’s using quirks that hard-counter Momo, like Ibara, Kendo, or Cementoss. Engage confidently.

## Itsuka Kendo (Both) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch046_profile.png" width="70"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch046var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Both Strike and Assault versions counter Momo. Use alphas to keep them off you and plant cannons on yourself for protection. Be ready to dodge everything. Teammates should assist here. Assault Kendo is easier to handle, while Strike Kendo is extremely powerful. Play very cautiously and with your team.

A hard counter to Momo. Her thorny hair ignores your shield, so don’t shield dash at her - only roll. Fight her indoors to maximize cannon damage. All her attacks have Super Armor, allowing her to tank damage. Engage only with a team and avoid if alone. Should be focused first as she can revive teammates.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even/Favorable🟢<br>
He's very manageable just watch out for his armored beta and invincible gamma if you try to start a combo. He's mostly going to be dash jump alphaing so just do the same, timing your alphas for when he lands. If he tries to run with beta just throw yours at him and if that doesn't down him you can chase if you want or just let it be since he has better movement than you. His super jump is terrible for escaping though, good all mights will not be using this to escape but if an all might tries to use it upclose you just kill them for that with a combo.
<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
His alpha prevents him from getting stunned and increases how much he can take before knockdown. It also reduces the damage he takes by 10% which barely matters. If he's holding alpha just start dash jumping to throw alphas at him and try to avoid his. Sometimes it can also be easier to be near the All Might and just constantly swap between being in front of him and being behind him, this can make it hard for the All Might to consistently hit you depending on their camera sensitivity. If he tries to get close to gamma you just throw a beta at him to make him lose the CD. If he tries to beta, you just roll it. This applies to both forms of his beta. Don't get in gamma range. He doesn't have the greatest wake-up options if you knock him down so you can just call out his wake-up with melee, gamma, beta or Special Action.

## Shota Aizawa <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch013/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch013_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
His special action and alpha make this Match-up insufferable at times, if he grabs you, you get chunked, and his Special Action just prevents you from fighting back or running. If you can land your beta or gamma before he grabs you or negates you with Special Action, you just ToD him. If he's constantly air alphaing the best way to deal with him is trying to kite him with alphas since unlike Strike Shigaraki, your alpha will actually hit his kick off the ground, you can just hit him with alpha debris mid-air or use gamma's dash on him after he kicks off the ground, since the tracking will usually hit him before he has a chance to alpha again during the flip, and from there you can either do an air combo or just go for gamma's shockwave for immediate damage which, if he's guard broken, you can just do a gamma shockwave combo. If he tries to run, your alpha hits his alpha kick so you can use that to your advantage.

## Present Mic <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch109/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch109_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Present Mic outranges you, if he's on high ground toss a beta to try and force him back and if his boombox is right next to him also make him get rid of it for a second. If he's on low ground just try to keep breaking the boombox with alpha since it does reduce his DPS. ToD-ing him is the best way to get rid of him but be aware that he can just beta you for hitting him with beta if you're too far to follow up with gamma as a true combo. He will also beta you for getting too close and then chunk you with either alpha or gamma as a follow up.

## Cementoss <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch101_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Dealing with Cementoss can be annoying since all his structures will block your attacks. Assault Shigaraki also can't reliably ToD him because of his alpha towering, so if you do plan to try to go for the ToD getting some damage in advance with alphas is a good way to make sure he dies once you get your hands on him. Mostly just try to avoid his attacks and take whatever openings you can get, if all you can do is go for beta into alpha just take it. Save your gammas for positioning unless you know for a fact you can kill him after landing it. Do not ever follow him into a tight space.
<br>

## Endeavor (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch023_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
His Special Action and beta makes him annoying to deal with since the former lets him float, reducing your combo damage. His beta is an extremely good get off of me/get back over here tool since it sends you towards him. If he's just floating with his Special Action you can try to throw a beta at him then use your own Special Action, assuming you're in range so your alpha debris shots do more damage, making it a bit easier. If he holds alpha on the ground you get to combo him for it. If he runs be aware that his beta will often be used to cut off your approach angles on him, he does slightly outpace your movement with his Special Action but not so much to the point where you can't keep up. If you try to run be mindful of that gamma since it hits through walls, if you decide to run try to have more than 200 HP so if he does call you out with gamma you at least live and can possibly still get away.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
His beta is really strong at closing off an area since the wall hitbox can be deceptive to where rolling will sometimes still get caught, if you're in his beta he gets to alpha or gamma you for big damage. If he alpha dumps you after beta be aware that his gamma is really good at catching your wake up option, so try to get away from it while you still have your i-frames. Like Strike Endeavor, he will also be using Special Action to float a good bit. You can do the same thing with a beta stun into your own Special Action to make your alpha debris hit a bit harder. Unlike Strike Endeavor, it can be easier to do an air combo on him since he doesn't have great tools for keeping someone off of him in the air, since his gamma only explodes on impact and does have startup "lag", and his beta only hits the floor so air combos can be pretty good against him if you get enough damage beforehand to actually kill him with one.

## Hawks (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch043_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
He outranges you, you cannot chase him and he will chase you to the ends of the earth. Assault Shigaraki is relying on dodging his beta and punishing him with a ToD during his endlag or catching him by surprise before he notices you at all. If he is in beta flight just roll the slashes or try and knock him out of it with gamma's shockwave, but be aware this is risky since he can just smack you for it and then you've lost a gamma. Hawks's gamma also gives him an easy time chasing you since it allows him to know your location the entire time it's active, as well as making it hard to sneak up on him if he tries to flee while you're marked. He's not hard to deal with, mostly just annoying.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴 (Giant Form)<br>
Don't be too close to her, despite her alpha only doing 50 per hit it still fires twice per 1 ammo with a fast fire rate, letting her get some really solid damage really quickly in close range. However, after her nerfs, her combos aren't too threatening. The main concern in this Match-Up is her giant form. If she decides to just go big you cannot contest that and just need to try and get somewhere that she can't chase you or hit you. Fighting her in locations where she's small makes her easy to deal with. If you beta her while she isn't using her own beta, she gets combo'd for free. You both have similar movement since she has gamma jump canceling and you have gamma shockwave, so you can chase each other easily on the ground, assault shig does have a better time moving vertically though thanks to the 2 Special Action charges.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Indoors he will win so just don't contest him indoors. He outranges you and his AoE is better than yours. Grab will also chunk your health bar so if he does land that just try to always mix up whether you air-wake or not, since Strike Shigaraki has a 50/50 follow up with his Special Action off his gamma. If he's putting out alphas constantly just dash jump away from them and throw alphas at him or beta stun him, just be aware if he reads you with his gamma or does beta close to the ground he can get to grab you for free. This is one of the few times where using gamma to go up into the air then pelt down alphas and betas is a solid option, but beware this does run the risk of getting you shot by others. If he alpha stacks where you're about to land you can use your Special Action to move away from his alpha stacks.

Throw alphas from afar to avoid being in combo range, let the other Assault Shigaraki approach first. If he tries to gamma at you try to roll it then beta or gamma him and combo for it. You can also throw a beta at him first to just get free alphas.

Don't contest him indoors, be aware that beta can be used to attack you around corners. If you decide to chase him roll his gamma. His jump height makes alphaing him a bit harder but just adjust your timing a bit and you can hit his landings pretty easily. Other quirks can make this Match-up annoying sometimes.

Alpha and beta do not care about his traps, gamma is the main thing going for him in this Match-up, and his alpha is fiction. If the Tech Dabi is sitting in traps, alpha will break them and beta just lets you stun him. Do not gamma at him or you will get hit by a trap. Just use gamma to break away or hit him through walls. Gamma's shockwave can also be an option for starting combos on him since you can use the flip to maneuver away from traps but still hit him, thoug not really recommended when you just win the ranged game for free.

If he's betaing at you, throw your own at him. If he's alphaing, throw alphas or a beta at him. You cannot do combos that involve gamma, Special Action or melee on him while he has gamma active. He does eat away at his own health so Assault Shigaraki's DoT + his own self damage really melts his HP, so beta into alpha mash to get rid of him.

She outranges you from really far away so just break the line of sight. Up close betas hurt, but they're easily dodgable, so you can just knock her out of it with a beta or gamma shockwave. Gamma's dash runs the risk of getting hit even if used from behind her. If she's betaing you can mostly just run and throw and alpha then keep doing it. If she takes your blood and transforms near you that is your window to combo her. If she's just using transformation to CD reset you can still combo her for doing it pretty easily, just be aware her transformation does have i-frames on start so she can use that to avoid a stun move. Running from her can be difficult if she has your blood since she has her movement + your movement + hers again. That also applies to chasing.

This Match-up is terrible. If she's CD resetting it's very hard to contest her, since she can just sit in the air for free, and if she turns into Assault Shigaraki she now has the potential to ToD you as well. She's harder to punish for transforming than her tech counterpart since her gamma lets her do it automatically, or she can just go up high reliably before transforming. Trying to bait and avoid her gamma then ToDing her is the best way to deal with her. Running usually isn't an option since she'll just pull you back with gamma.

Basically the same as how you fight most beamers, he outranges you but unlike most of them, he can increase his DPS with his beta clone, but your own alpha easily kills the clone while still being able to hit him. If he's on high ground you can just try to use beta to force him to step back to break line of sight. If he's in mid-range and tries to gamma to close the gap, you can just push him back with double beta or count his gammas and try to stay out of range until he's out or at one of them, then either combo him when he's out or try and force a trade when he's at one then combo him. His gamma is good at catching wake-ups in close range but overall he's not too hard to deal with.

Compress' alpha stun is his best tool against you since if he gets it, your guard is gone and so is some HP. If he's holding up his beta you just throw alphas at his feet or gamma him if you're close enough, but be aware that he can dodge your gamma if he reacts. If you throw alpha debris or beta debris, they will be reflected at you with higher damage. His gamma is hard to stop unless you've already beta'd him, so if you knock him down there isn't much you can do to stop his escape option if he isn't immediately one shot. If he's sitting on high ground just toss a beta at the wall to force him back. He can easily chase you since his gamma goes really far. If he's just tossing trucks down after gammaing up just try to avoid as many as you can and when he lands try to chunk him for it if he doesn't immediately gamma back up.

Overhaul's ability to heal himself and smack you off of him can make trying to ToD him less enticing to go for. Gamma in this match-up is mostly just for manuevering and breaking off to heal if needed, or just catching a roll with gamma's shockwave while he's on HP to do a gamma shockwave combo. Gamma's dash will get you smacked off of him most of the time. Beta debris into alpha mash is mostly what you'll be using in this match-up combo wise. Try to stay at a range where his gamma is still reactable so you can easily dodge it, dash jump alphas are mostly what you're using in this. If you see him pop special action to heal himself this is where you ToD him.

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Kurogiri's gamma remote portal vortex can be difficult to deal with since he can just keep himself out of Assault Shiggy's range. Gammaing up to get in range to throw his projectiles at will often get you beta pulled towards the Kurogiri player, so do not to do this. Mostly just try to predict when he's going to throw an attack at you with his portal vortex or try to immediately break line of sight and lose it. Against Kurogiri himself if you do beta in the air at all you will likely get pulled so doing it on the ground and dodge rolling after the throw is best to avoid getting punished for free. It can go either way but Kurogiri overall has the edge.
