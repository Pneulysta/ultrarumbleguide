Tamaki Amajiki is a disruptor character who excels at adaptive control and precision zoning. While he has strong tools for punishing and escaping, he isn’t a frontline fighter who can brute-force his way through fights. Tamaki thrives as a reactive fighter, using his Beta vanish, pull, and wall-piercing plasma cannon to disrupt enemies and protect his team from a distance when needed. He’s especially effective at punishing careless opponents who overextend or underestimate his ability to reposition and counterattack.<br>
<br>
Tamaki has significant technical depth, with conditional mechanics that reward players who master his timing and spacing. His Alpha skill offers ranged pokes and flexible grabs, his Beta provides an evasive vanish, and his Gamma beam controls the space from far away. However, because Tamaki lacks sustained forward mobility and has tight cooldowns, positioning and skill management are critical. Along with holding smart angles, these three qualities are often the key to surviving and winning fights.</br>

## Alpha Skill #1 - Marlin Rapier
<p align="center">

</p>

Marlin Rapier is a precision-based projectile attack that fires a piercing strike resembling a marlin’s horn. It rewards players who can land hits with the tip, dealing significantly more damage and downpower when the strike connects at max range. It is ideal for mid-range poking, and is especially effective at finishing off low-health enemies or pressuring revives from a safe distance. Skilled players will maximize its tip damage by maintaining optimal spacing and timing.

## Alpha Skill #2 - Octopus Whip
<p align="center">

</p>

In Tamaki’s Aim Mode, his marlin is replaced by an octopus tentacle, with which he pulls enemies towards him, disrupting positioning and setting up combos. It is a powerful tool for isolating targets or peeling for teammates. It’s especially effective when used from high ground, allowing Tamaki to control engagements while air stalling, and without overcommitting.

## Beta Skill - Octopus Mirage
<p align="center">

</p>

Octopus Mirage is a sweeping dash attack that deals high damage and applies massive downpower, which also has tracking. On hit, Tamaki vanishes using octopus mimicry, temporarily increasing his movement speed in the process. He reappears either after a short delay or when activating another non-Beta skill. This vanish mechanic makes Octopus Mirage a powerful tool for baiting enemies or escaping pressure during fights. Skilled players will use it to reposition mid-combat, or for stalling when waiting for a group heal with sporadic movement.<br>
<br>
While vanished, Tamaki becomes almost invisible, allowing him to safely rotate or set up his next move. It’s especially effective when used to reposition for escaping unfair matchups or dangerous zones in combination with his Special Action. Overall, this move maximizes his survivability and counterplay potential. It should be noted that while you see yourself as reddish while vanished, enemies will see no color, but keep in mind that you're not fully invisible either.

## Gamma Skill - Plasma Cannon
<p align="center">

</p>

Plasma Cannon is a multi-shot energy beam that Tamaki fires in a wide arc, capable of piercing through walls and obstacles. It consumes ammo in bursts and can be held to charge, increasing its damage and range. It is effective for zoning, finishing off downed enemies, or pressuring revives from far away. The beam’s ability to hit through terrain makes it a powerful tool for punishing grouped up enemies.<br>
<br>
When held, Plasma Cannon builds up energy and releases a stronger blast that deals increased damage and maintains the same down power, making it ideal for consistent long-range pressure. To note, if Tamaki is hit by Nejire’s skill while charging, the beam instantly reaches full charge, allowing for surprise snipes. Pretty simple skill.<br>
<br>
Be extremely careful when using this ability, as using it leaves you very vulnerable, which can be fatal in the open and often what kills unexperienced Tamaki players.

## Special Action - Wing Claw
<p align="center">

</p>

As Tamaki’s vertical mobility tool, Wing Claw launches him high into the air with a swift upward strike using bird talons. It consumes one ammo and has a short 4-second reload, making it a reliable escape or repositioning option. Its height and speed allow Tamaki to disengage from close-range threats and gain high ground in the process. This move also functions as an attack. He kicks the enemy up into the air, which can be used to perform aerial combos. Though it’s Tamaki’s true mobility skill, its low cooldown and vertical reach make it a vital part of his survival and zoning power.

</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

Tamaki’s ground melee consists of a three-hit combo chain, the first hit, an opening strike that locks targets into the rest of the combo, the second hit, that of which deals the same amount of damage as the first, and finally a rapid triple burst acting as his Melee 3, with the final hit ending the chain. Tamaki’s ground melee is reliable for close-range trades and quick knockdown setups when paired with Wing Claw, Marlin Rapier tipper shots, or even Octopus Mirage to end the combo. It’s especially useful for confirming damage after a successful pull.

</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Tamaki’s air melee is a single strike that deals half of an enemy's downpower gauge in one hit. This is Tamaki’s strongest melee option for burst knockdown setups. It’s ideal to use after Octopus Whip and before launching with Wing Claw. Because of its high downpower, it should be used in the middle of combos in order for Tamaki’s punishing game to be consistent. It also has the quirk of giving you subtle upwards momentum, which can be used to stay airborne for longer if needed.
