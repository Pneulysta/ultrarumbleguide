Hawks are birds of prey of the family Accipitridae. They are very widely distributed and are found on all continents, except Antarctica.

The subfamily Accipitrinae includes goshawks, sparrowhawks, sharp-shinned hawks, and others. This subfamily are mainly woodland birds with short broad wings, long tails, and high visual acuity. They hunt by dashing suddenly from a concealed perch.

In the United States, members of the Buteo group are also called hawks, though birds of this group are called buzzards in other parts of the world. Generally, buteos have broad wings and sturdy builds. They are relatively larger-winged and shorter-tailed than accipiters, and fly further distances in open areas. Buteos descend or pounce on their prey rather than engaging in fast, horizontal pursuit.

## Alpha Skill - Wingbeat

Hawks' alpha skill allows him to shoot homing feathers that follow the enemy. These feathers are a bit slow and easy for your opponent to dodge in a 1v1, but it can be a tricky annoyance as a 3rd party tool or as means of placing pressure onto the opponent. They're also very useful when dealing with airborne targets, especially slower ones like Nejire or characters running away in a straight line.<br>
<br>
In aim mode, your feathers lose their tracking ability, but they also become much faster, they stay clumped together, and gain extra range, which makes them your main option for ranged damage. Landing his aimed alpha consistently requires you to be quite decent at aiming, and also limits your mobility, as you can't move much while aiming, so it's recommended to use aiming mode in the middle of a jump, while falling, or after gamma to keep yourself in motion. The unaimed version doesn't suffer as much from this issue since it can be paired with his Special Action to shoot while moving.

Hawks' beta skill allows him to dash at the aimed direction. When hitting an enemy with it he will enter Free Flight mode for the duration of the skill, which allows him to fly in any direction. Pressing this skill again while in Free Flight mode will make Hawks perform a Free Flight Slash, becoming faster for a split second and dealing damage. This skill can be cancelled by holding it, though it has some endlag, so be mindful of that.<br>
<br>
This is Hawks' main source of damage, slashing through opponents as he flies. In order for this move to be properly use, you must quickly turn your camera around after landing the initial dash and perform a Free Flight Slash, this is done to take advantage of the initial hit's stun, by turning your camera around you can quickly dash back with a Free Flight Slash while they're stunned, allowing you to guarantee one hit after the dash. This skill's damage area has a surprisingly generous lingering on its slash, which means that even if you slash a bit too early, you might still hit the enemy. Each use of this skill will take 50% of the gauge, meaning it can only be used twice before it goes on cooldown, however, landing it resets the percentage back at 100%, and will consume it as you fly, taking around 20% for each Free Flight Slash. Cancelling the skill uses the whole gauge. It's also worth noting that this skill's initial dash has very good tracking, which makes it quite easier to land.

<br>
Beta can also be used as mobility. Due to the fact you can use it twice before it goes on cooldown, you can use one dash to get closer to the top of a building, and/or if needed, hit the dash to enter Free Flight mode and fly away when your Special Action is on cooldown, however this latter case isn't recommended, as the move is slow and easy to dodge, meaning they can easily punish you to death (which you might be close to if you need to run away in the first place.)
