# <a style="color: rgba(175,100,237,255) !important;">MISCELLANEOUS: Additional Rewards, Currencies, Player Profile, Buddy List, Settings and more!</a><br>
In this sub-guide we will cover a bunch of smaller things that aren't deep enough to make a whole page for.

# Additional Rewards
In the Play Screen there's a button called "Notifications", here you can see both people that joined your agency and invites from other players to their party. However, sometimes you can also find rewards, mostly league rewards or from special events like anniversary, anime episode releases (mostly applies to the Vigilantes anime now).

# Login Bonus
Every day you can claim a login bonus reward. If you miss one, it won't be skipped, you will just be late to the reward, but you will have to wait an extra day for the next one that otherwise you'd have obtained that same day. You can spend 500 Hero Crystals to unlock the Premium Login Bonus for that week, which gives more Roll Tickets and Slot Unlock Keys, if you have more than 13000 Crystals, this is a good investment!

You can also find Special Login Bonuses that appear from time to time and often give 10 tickets every day for a week, these often come with a character or battle style release.

New players will also see the TUNING Login Bonus, which will allow you to obtain some Character Data early for TUNING.

# Currencies

# Player Profile
This can be accessed from the "Menu" Screen and is split into 5 sections.

## Profile
This bit displays the character you're playing as, their build, the costume you're using, the agency you belong to, your Research Notebook level, your "My Banner", your rank (both your numerical ranking place and the actual rank you're in), the nameplate you're using, and your Player Level, which you increase by simply playing matches and serve as an indicator of seniority/veterancy.

You can edit your profile by clicking the "Edit Profile" button, this will show 5 options:

- Player Name: This is used to change your name, which must be within 14 characters long and use up to 6 numbers.
- Change Nameplaye: Here you can view all your nameplates and select the one you want to display publicly.
- Edit Bio: Here you can edit your bio. You can use a maximum of 30 characters.
- Customize Character: This simply sends you to the Customize Character screen for the character you have currently selected.
- My Banner: This simply sends you to the My Banner screen.

## Billboard Chart History
Here you can see the people that have recently given you "Likes", as well as how many, and how many you've received both today and throughout the season.

## Battle Record
Here you can see your ranked stats, which are also public for others to see if they visit your profile from the Lobby. You can see your stats for all seasons, these stats are:

- Battles Fought
- Wins
- Battles Won (Not K.O.'d)
- Damage Dealt
- Max Damage
- Average Damage
- K.o.s Inflicted
- K.O.s Received
- K.O. Ratio: The average amount of KOs you inflict before being killed.
- K.O. Assists: KOs you contributed to but whose DOWN were inflicted by a teammate.
...and more!

The left column represents the total (or average for some of the stats) across all seasons, while the right column has the stats for the current season. You can use the arrows at the top to check previous seasons. One's profile is often checked to know the enemy or teammate's level of performance, usually looking at KO ratio and damage stats. Though, keep in mind this system is not perfect, as some might have inflated stats from bot lobbies, or lower stats due to playing characters they're less well versed with for the sake of fun.

## Buddy List
Here you can see all the friends you have added, the invites you have (though it's better to check this in the Notifications button in the Play Screen), the invites you've sent, the people you have blocked (AKA, the people that you won't be put in the same party as so long as you are the host). You can also see your agency's members, the people you've recently played with (that were on your team), and platform friends that you have added to playstation, xbox, switch or steam.

## Item List
The list of all the resources you own.
